## Hints

1. Do not forget to semantically name your images.

2. Make sure that your images have an appropriate file size.

3. You do not need to write any custom CSS or JavaScript. In fact, avoid it.

4. The typography sizing are the default sizes defined within the framework. All of the colours used come from the framework.

5. Your HTML must be sectioned appropriately and must produce a logical document outline.

6. Your HTML must be valid (i.e. not throw any validation errors) and have a semantic title.

7. The header element is ‘sticky’ and stays at the top of the screen when scrolling.

8. The navigation is fully responsive and expands at the large breakpoint.

9. The navigation links can link to the different sections on the page, however, that is optional.

10. Both the toggle navigation and the carousel require Bootstrap’s JavaScript library.

12. Run Lighthouse in order to audit your website and add any missing meta tags. Due to the length of Bootstrap's stylesheets and JavaScript library, you will never get a _perfect_ score; this is okay.
